# Voice-UI
Speech and Voice oriented projects

This repo includes a deep-learning voice recognition project. It was completed as part of Udacity NLP nano-degree.
The project tests multiple neural network architectures to detect the one that performs best with voice related data.
At the end, we implemented a complex network which starts with a CNN layer, followed by a deep bidi LSTM network.
